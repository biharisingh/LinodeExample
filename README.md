# Using Emacs in Terminal

## Why Emacs ?

Emacs is a very extensible and capable single-threaded editor, written in lisp. It is capable of doing _almost anything_. Joke going around is _Emacs is an OS that lacks a decent editor_. It is not as lightweight as vim, but is capable of much more - like playing _Tetris_. Emacs-ers are capable of doing a full day of work, without ever needing to exit emacs. From viewing mails to setting up to-dos, emacs has community provided packages for all.


## Installing Emacs

Emacs comes with GUI and Terminal version.
GUI version has more features than terminal version, but on servers, we have to use emacs on terminal.

To install Emacs: 

```
sudo apt-get update && apt-get install emacs-nox
```

To start Emacs, write:
```
emacs
```
